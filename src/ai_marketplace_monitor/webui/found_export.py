"""Build and serialize the "found items" export from the on-disk cache.

Reads the notified/matched listings out of the diskcache and joins them with
cached listing details and AI ratings to produce CSV-ready rows.  Read-only:
no scraping and no new persistence.

Memory use is bounded to the notified subset, not the whole cache: the full
``LISTING_DETAILS`` / ``AI_INQUIRY`` namespaces (every listing ever scraped and
every AI inquiry) are never loaded wholesale.  A first pass collects the small
set of listing ids and hashes the notified rows actually reference; a second
pass loads only those.  Rows and the CSV itself are produced lazily so an
export of many records never materializes all rows or the full CSV at once.
